'''
The purpose of this example is to show the user how to use the PyTradier library in conjunction with scikit-learn
for machine learning. This example takes training data from PyTradier, trains an SVM classifier with arbitrary labels,
then predicts a buy or sell action for an arbitrary time and price. 

Note... The labels for the training data in this example are arbitrary (i.e. random), so there isn't any connection
between the labels and the data. Due to this, this example is unlikely to be accurate in predicting a buy/sell action.
